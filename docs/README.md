## Core Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for content structure
- **CSS**: Styling using Tailwind CSS framework
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ for interactive elements
- **EmailJS**: For form submissions without a backend
- **AOS**: Animate On Scroll library for animations
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library

## Development Methodology

The portfolio website was developed using a component-based approach, focusing on:

1. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptable layouts
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
3. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimal dependencies and efficient code
5. **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations and user feedback

## Implementation Process

1. **Planning & Structure**: Created wireframes and planned section layouts
2. **HTML Structure**: Built semantic HTML document with all content sections
3. **Styling**: Applied Tailwind CSS for responsive design
4. **Interactivity**: Added JavaScript for animations and user interactions
5. **Optimization**: Improved performance and accessibility
6. **Testing**: Cross-browser compatibility testing
